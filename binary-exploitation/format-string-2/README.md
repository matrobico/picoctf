### Solution
Unlike format-string-1, which had us simply print values off the stack with format specifiers and could be easily brute forced by just printing values until you hit the flag, this challenge seems to indicate we'll need to write to the stack (which we know we can do with %n).

Opening the source, it's immediately clear we're going to have to overwrite the "sus" variable with the value the program is checking for. In order to do that, we'll probably have to supply enough input so that %n writes a high enough output counter value to the *proper* place on the stack where "sus" is located.

The decimal value the program checks for is 1734437990. We can write that many "A" values, then use "%n" to write the counter to memory. They key here is probably to figure out where to use "%n".
