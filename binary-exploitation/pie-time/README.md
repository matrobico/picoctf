# PIE TIME
> Binary Exploitation

### Description
> Can you try to get the flag? Beware we have PIE! Connect to the program with netcat
>
> Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
>
> **Hint 1:** Can you figure out what changed between the address you found locally and in the server output?

### Solution
This challenge is focused around position indendent executable, as the implies.

Connecting to the challenge instance reveals that the program expects an address, which the program will then jump to. We're also initially given the address of main. Since this is a PIE, we can open up the binary in a debugger, print the address of main() and win(), then subtract the two to figure out the offset between them.

Then, since we're given the address of main, we can just add the offset to that address, enter that, and get our flag.


### Flag
`picoCTF{b4s1c_p051t10n_1nd3p3nd3nc3_801240da}`
