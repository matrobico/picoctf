This repository contains solutions and write-ups from the avaialable PicoCTF challenges, sorted by year.

# Ethos
The general ethos behind this is to try my best for 1-2 hours, and if at that point I still can't solve it, I look up help. Otherwise, I get burnt out, lose interest, and never actually learn how to solve the challenge. It's better to give a good effort and then just look up the answer (and understand it of course), rather than get frustrated and overwhelmed, never solve it, and be too stubborn to find out how.

The main goal is to learn.
