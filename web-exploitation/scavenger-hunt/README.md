### Description

> **Hint 1: You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

### Solution
Navigating to the provided link, we're met with a very basic web page. Nothing out of the ordinary yet, but if we inspect the page source, we can see a part of the flag is in the comments. Therefore, it's likely there are parts of the flag tucked away in various aspects (e.g., HTML, CSS, etc).

Clicking on the CSS shows us the second part of the flag - great. Clicking on the Javascript shows us an interesting comment: "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?". This is usually done by the "robots.txt" file, so if navigate to that, we get another part of the flag and another clue: "I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?". 

It's interesting that the word "Access" is capitlized, so that's probably a clue to look at. Doing some Google searching, there's a file called ".htaccess" that defines a set of restrictions and configurations one can set up on a folder and its contents, so navigating to "http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.htaccess" reveals the next part of the flag and yet another clue: "I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."

This appears to be hinting at a related Mac storage file: DS_STORE (which is silly because what does that have to do with Web Exploitation?).
