# head-dump
> Web Exploitation

### Description
> Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag. The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the server’s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.
>
> Hint 1: Explore backend development with us.
> Hint 2: The head was dumped.

### Solution
It seems we'll have to poke around the website and see what info is given and exposed. Seeing the the challenge explicitly calls out the API Documentation page, there's a decent chance that's a great spot to poke around.

Clicking around a bit to view the different pages on this site, we hit the "api-docs/" page, which seems to expose the websites API docs. And interestingly, we see a /heapdump available. Immediately, I believe we can send a GET request with this command and maybe get some goodies stuck in memory. Clicking on this command, we can even execute in in browser and download the response.

Searching through the file within the response for "picoCTF{", we see our flag.

### Flag
`picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_dc0756a3}`
