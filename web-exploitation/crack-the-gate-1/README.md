# Crack the Gate 1
> Web Exploitation

### Description
> We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. 
You can download the challenge files [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_rhea/20/challenge.zip):

> Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

> Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

### Solution
Spinning up an instance and inspecting the source, we can see comments were left in the source code.

Based on one of the hints, this comment was left in ROT13, so using a ROT13 decoder, we get "NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes".

Therefore, we can construct a POST to the login page with curl which includes this header - as well as the content type we're sending (JSON) and the data itself.

`curl -X POST -H "X-Dev-Access: yes" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org", "password":"test"}' http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:62254/login`

### Flag
