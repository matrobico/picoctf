### Solution
This seems to be another challenge where we need to use the developer tools to inspect the site. Taking a look at the difference sources/assets loaded from this site, we can see a weird string (cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMWY4MzI2MTV9) within "about.html" towards the bottom. Seeing as how this challenge hints at decoding something, perhaps this string is the encoded flag.

Taking it to cyberchef and using the magic recipe reveals it's yet another base64 encoded flag.

### Flag
`picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_1f832615}`
