# Insp3ct0r
> Web Exploitation

### Description
> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670
>
> **Hint 1: How do you inspect web code on a browser?**
> **Hint 2: There's 3 parts**

### Solution
We're given a website to inspect, so naturally, we can insepct the page through developer tools. Inspecting the HTML, we can find 1/3 of the flag. Since the HTML contains 1/3, we can assume the CSS and JS will contain the other 2/3s. Looking in the "sources" tab of developer tools, we can find the other parts to the flag in the respective css and javascript files the site loads.

### Flag
`picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}`
