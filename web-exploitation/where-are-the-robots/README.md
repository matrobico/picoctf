### Solution
Navigating to the link provided in the challenge description takes us to a welcome page saying "Where are the robots?". Taking this as a hint to check out the `robots.txt` file, we can see the website creator doesn't want visitors to `/1bb4c.html`. Navigating to this file, we get our flag.

### Flag
`picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}`
